# üëã Hello `wasmtime`

This section of the tutorial introduces [wasmtime][wasmtime], a WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime and one of the [Bytecode Alliance][bca]'s reference implementations for the WebAssembly System Interface ([WASI](https://wasi.dev/)) standards[^1].

In this workshop, we're going to:
- Clone an example repository,
- Build a WebAssembly component
- Serve web traffic with our component using `wasmtime`.

[bca]: https://bytecodealliance.org

## üì¶ 1. Setup

> [!NOTE]
> This first example is Rust-focused, but we'll move onto working with other languages (Go, TypeScript, Python) in a later tutorial stage.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer to not clone and install things locally, feel free to work from a Docker container with:
>
> `docker run --rm -it rust:1-slim-buster`.
>
> Once you're in the Docker container, you can install the basic dependencies for the demo with:
>
> `apt update; apt install curl pkg-config -y;`

### 1.1 (optional) ü¶Ä Install Rust

**This step is only necessary if you're *not* using `docker`**

As this demo will be working primarily in [Rust][rust], you'll need to install the Rust language toolchain.

You can find out [how to install Rust from rust-lang.org][rust-install].

[rust]: https://rust-lang.org
[rust-install]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### 1.2 ‚¨áÔ∏è Clone Dan Gohman's [``sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http`][github-sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http] repository

You can clone the repository with `git`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http.git
```

[sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http]: https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http/

### 1.3 üèóÔ∏è Install `wasmtime` and related tools

Before we can build WebAssembly components in Rust, we'll need to install some Rust ecosystem tooling:

Here is some information on the tools we'll be installing

| Tool                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`wasmtime`][wasmtime]               | Leading WebAssembly runtime implementation, developed by the [Bytecode Alliance][bca], which supports basic WebAssembly and many more advanced standards. |
| [`wasm-tools`][wasm-tools]           | Tooling for manipulating and modifying WebAssembly binaries and more.                                                                                     |
| [`cargo-component`][cargo-component] | Rust CLI for building WebAssembly components with Rust                                                                                                    |

We can install all the tooling we'll need with [`cargo`][cargo], the package ("crate") manager of the Rust toolchain:

```console
cargo install wasmtime-cli wasm-tools cargo-component
```

## 2. ‚ÅâÔ∏èWhat the WIT

Here we'll learn about the [WebAssembly Interface Types specification][wit], which helps us build and connect components with declarative, high level types.

### 2.1 Define the WIT

From the [**`hello-wasi-http`**][github-sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http] repository you cloned locally, take a look at the WebAssembly Interface Types in [`wit/world.wit`](https://github.com/sunfishcode/hello-wasi-http/blob/main/wit/world.wit):

```wit
package sunfishcode:hello-wasi-http;

world target-world {
  include wasi:http/proxy@0.2.0;
}
```

This `world` defines all of the interfaces (and functions) that this component will import and export. To make it fully compliant with the `wasi:http` standard it includes all of the interfaces in the `wasi:http/proxy` world, most notably `wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0` which is for handling an incoming HTTP request.

The `world` is also embedded into every component you build; you can inspect every Wasm component to see exactly what its capabilities are before running it. This is a game-changer for security with fine-grained allow lists of capabilities, and it lets you understand a component without seeing the source code. Think of the tools we have to inspect containers, their contents, and what they do, it's very difficult to inspect binaries and containers for what they'll do at runtime before running them.

Feel free to take a look in `src/lib.rs` as well, where you can find the implementation code for this component directly using the WASI interface.

```rust
// ...imports

impl bindings::exports::wasi::http::incoming_handler::Guest for Component {
    fn handle(_request: IncomingRequest, outparam: ResponseOutparam) {
        let hdrs = Fields::new();
        let resp = OutgoingResponse::new(hdrs);
        let body = resp.body().expect("outgoing response");

        ResponseOutparam::set(outparam, Ok(resp));

        let out = body.write().expect("outgoing stream");
        out.blocking_write_and_flush(b"Hello, wasi:http/proxy worldddd!\n")
            .expect("writing response");

        drop(out);
        OutgoingBody::finish(body, None).unwrap();
    }
}
```

This looks pretty similar in each language, and the use of the interface directly here is a good learning exercise.[^2]

## üõ†Ô∏èBuild your component

Building your component is similar to building a Rust binary, simply run:
```bash
cargo component build
```

This will create a component in `target/wasm32-wasi/debug`, you can use the **wasm-tools** CLI to inspect its wit:
```bash
‚ûú wasm-tools component wit target/wasm32-wasi/debug/hello_wasi_http.wasm
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.0;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.0;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.0;
  import wasi:http/types@0.2.0;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.0;
}
```

As you can see, this component **import**s standard libraries for IO and standard output/error/in, and **export**s the HTTP incoming handler. You know that this component will _never_ be able to access files, make requests of its own, run arbitrary commands, etc without ever looking at the source code.

## üëü Run your component
You can run your component using **wasmtime serve**, which provides the implementation for the HTTP world.

```bash
wasmtime serve -Scommon ./target/wasm32-wasi/debug/hello_wasi_http.wasm
```

In another terminal, try to `curl localhost:8080` and see the hello!

#### Footnotes

[^1]: [jco](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco), a NodeJS runtime and JavaScript tooling project, is another reference implementation for WASI.
[^2]: There are multiple tools that abstract this interface usage, like [wasm-http-tools](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/wasm-http-tools) which supports generating a component from OpenAPI / Swagger specifications.
